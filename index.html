  <h2>
    Where I'm From:
  </h2>
    <p>
    Hi! I'm Robb. I grew up in Syracuse, New York and have lived in and around Seattle for the past nine years. I love it out here, but sometimes I miss having distinct seasons-especially in winter.
    </p>
  <h2>
    My Educational Background: 
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li> I went to St.John's College, a very small school in Annapolis, Maryland.</li> 
    <ul>
      <li>My bachelor's degree is in "Philosophy" and "The History of Math & Science"-- but I didn't exactly pick those majors.</li>
      <li> St. John's had one universal curriculum: It covered the development of mathematics, philosophy, literature, and science from ancient Greece to the late modern period.</li> 
      <li>The focus was on reading primary sources when possible in Greek, French, and English--except the German ones, we used only translations for those.
      <li>St. John's had only discussion-based classes-- no lectures at all other than optional ones on the weekends. </li>
    </ul>   
  <li>After that--though not immediately-- I finished pre-med here in Seattle, but went a different direction afterwards.</li>
  <li> I completed some graduate-level public health coursework too, but had to withdraw before getting my master's.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>
    My Employment History:
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>My first job was at a hole-in-the-wall jewelry store in "downtown" Annapolis while I was there during the school year. It reeked of sandalwood and patchouli, but worked well with my school schedule. When it was my shift, I was the only employee in the store and did everything from working the register to washing the windows. I even made some earrings and a necklace or two.</li> 
    <li>After moving to Seattle, I worked a series of desk jobs as a temp while in school.</li>
    <li>I also did a weekly shift on the King county crisis hotline (then called "Crisis Clinic") for a year and change before moving north into Snohomish County.</li>   
    <li>For the past few years, I worked for a legal administrator that mostly handled class-action lawsuits. Lots of paperwork. I started as a temp, but stuck around and was promoted a few times to an assistant project manager. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>
    Future Goals:
  </h2>
  <p>
    I hope to build on my eclectic educational background by establish the coding skills for a career that will require a satisfying degree of critical thinking. Outside of career hopes, I've enjoyed playing the guitar in my spare time for the past few years and intend to keep working at it for years to come.
