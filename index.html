<h2>
  Where I'm From:
</h2>
  <p>
  Hi! I'm Robb. I grew up in Syracuse, New York and have lived in and around Seattle for the past nine years. I love it out here, but sometimes I miss having distinct seasons-especially in winter.
  </p>
<h2>
  My Educational Background: 
</h2>
<p>
  My bachelor's degree is technically in Philosophy and The History of Math & Science-- but I didn't exactly pick those majors. I went to St.John's College, a very small school in Annapolis, Maryland. St. John's had one universal curriculum: It covered the development of mathematics, philosophy, and literature from ancient Greece to the late modern period with a focus on primary sources--except German, we used translations for those-- and only discussion-based classes. I'm not sure if I would have gone to college otherwise.
</p>
<p>
  After that--though not immediately-- I finished pre-med here in Seattle, but went a different direction afterwards. I completed some graduate-level public health coursework too, but had to withdraw before getting my master's.
</p>
<h2>
  My Employment History:
</h2>
<p>
  Other than the odd paid work as a teenager, my first job was at a hole-in-the-wall jewelry store in "downtown" Annapolis while I was there during the school year. It reeked of sandalwood and patchouli, but worked well with my school schedule. When it was my shift, I was the only employee in the store and did everything from working the register to washing the windows. I even made some earrings and a necklace or two.
</p>
<p>
  After moving to Seattle, I worked a series of desk jobs as a temp while in school. I also did a weekly shift on the King county crisis hotline (then called "Crisis Clinic") for a year and change before moving north into Snohomish County.
</p>
<p>
  For the past few years, I worked for a legal administrator that mostly handled class-action lawsuits. Lots of paperwork. I started as a temp, but stuck around and was promoted a few times to an assistant project manager. 
</p>
<h2>
  Future Goals:
</h2>
<p>
  I hope to build on my eclectic educational background by establish the coding skills for a career that will require a satisfying degree of critical thinking. Outside of career hopes, I enjoy playing the guitar in my spare time and intend to work at it for years to come.
