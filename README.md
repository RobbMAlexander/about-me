## Project Overview

This web page serves as a short autobiographical resource and a means of practicing some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals over a few iterations.

## Objectives (by Iteration)

### Lab 02

* Structure working HTML for a viewable page, using properly formatted tags and elements:
`<body></body>`; `<p></p>`;`<style></style>`; `<script></script>`; etc.

* Use CSS (external, in accompanying file "css/style.css") to style page for readability and distinction:
`background-color`; `color`; etc.

* Use JS (external, in accompanying file "js/app.js") to produce user prompts, then feed that input into alerts that incorporate a limited range of valid values:
`let user = prompt('Hello! Welcome to my Bio page-- what\'s your name?')
  alert('Hey ' + user + ', here are a few quick questions about my Bio that are explained better on the page.');`

### Lab 03

* Guidelines and restrictions:
  * Use conditionals
  * *No* functions

* Add ordered list (`<ol>`) and unordered lists (`<ul>`) to/of existing content.

* Add additional user prompt question that uses numeric input then evaluates input for `>` or `<` comparison, a maxiumum of 4 times, alerting user on status for each attempt and of compared value after final attempt.

* Add additional user prompt question that allows for multiple values from an array, with a maximum of 6 attempts, then print array to user.

* For above additions: track correct answer proportion, alert with value after all other prompts & alerts.
